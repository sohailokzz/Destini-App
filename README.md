# distini_app

A new Flutter project.
The seventh that I have done learning my Flutter Development.

## Getting Started

In this project, we will be building a choose our own adventure game like Bandersnatch. 
In the process, you should apply your knowledge from the last module (Quizzler) to use Dart OOP principles to build a well organised project.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
